# Objective of the repository
Elaborate using matplotlib and seaborn a way of plotting infrared spectra of molecules simpler and clearer than the current software used in reaserches. In a near future I have the goal of link the software made by me to a database and, using AI, return to the user a percentile of match between the ideal spectra and the one made in the analysis.
