# Objective of the repository
Elaborate using plotly a way of plotting infrared spectra of molecules simpler and clearer than the current software used in researches. In a near future I have the goal of link the software made by me to a database and, using AI, return to the user a percentage of match between the ideal spectra and the one made in the analysis.
