# Objective of the repository
Elaborate using plotly an interactive way of plotting infrared spectra of molecules simpler and clearer than the current software used in researches. The final representation looks like the following picture. In a near future I have the goal of link the software made by me to a database and, using AI, return to the user a percentage of match between the ideal spectra and the one made in the analysis.
